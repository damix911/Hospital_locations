Need help with communicating two javascript files.

Im having issues with communicating two javascript files so that the results from the query.js 
file would show up only within the circle of the graphics layer from the querttest.js file. 
I tried to attempt at using the define in the querttest.js file and AMD Modules but I can figure it out.
